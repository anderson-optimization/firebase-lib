## `firebase-lib` Documentation

### Contributing Changes

The general recommendations for contributions are to use the latest JavaScript
features, have tests with complete code coverage, and provide documentation.
The latter may be necessary only if a new feature is added.  Use of TypeScript's
types is discouraged.

Use of semantic versioning is preferred.  Bumping minor or patch parts of a
version number can be done via npm.

```
npm version patch
```
