## `firebase-lib` Documentation

### Contributing Changes

The general recommendations for contributions are to use the latest JavaScript
features, have tests with complete code coverage, and provide documentation.
The latter may be necessary only if a new feature is added.  Use of TypeScript's
types is discouraged.  Instead, self-documenting code, thorough tests, and
complete usage notes are preferred.
